# Headlines Wordcloud Generator 新闻爬取
A backbone for news and analysis prototype 
This application scrapes the headlines within a 5 days period from https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp and outputs a wordcloud. The start date of the time period can be specified. If no time period is specified, the application scrapes the headlines from the past 5 days.
Note: The period must be after 2015 as the website did not exist before then.
项目说明: 对某新闻网站进行爬取，或定时对实时新闻进行自动爬取。该程序自动爬取BBC中文网的新闻头条，并将其中的关键词组织成个文字云。

Attached are examples of a wordclouds generated.
